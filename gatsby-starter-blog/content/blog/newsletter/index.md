## Why I created a newsletter

I have been working in the cloud for a few years now and I have seen a lot of changes. My Microsoft MVP in Azure and AI were both given to me by trying to keep up with the latest and greatest in Azure. First, it was pragmatic, my team needed someone to get things done in CI/CD and infrastructure as code. Just graduating from college I volunteered to read documentation and learn "Azure". While I was learning I also documented my learnings and shared them with the community. 

My goal with this news letter is 2 fold:
1. I want a place to share anything I'm helping with in the community. Until now I've had a podcast, meetup, Youtube, blog, etc. I am hoping this newsletter will be a great place to aggregate all of the content! 
2. I am hoping this newsletter will help keep me accountable for blogging on a weekly basis. As I continue to blog it will help push me to keep learning and keep writing. 

## What I plan to include in it

I plan to include a lot of different things in my newsletter. I plan to include things like:

- Anything that we cover in the user groups
- Anything that you might need help with or are struggling to solve
- My own opinions on the latest and greatest in the cloud industry
- Azure Cloud Talk Podcast episodes
- Tips and tricks that I've learned the hard way
  - Not always super technical
  - Not always super dev focused
  - And probably not always super helpful
- And more!

## What you should expect from it

I plan to send out a newsletter every week. I do have a full newsletter system behind the scenes so you shouldn't be afraid to subscribe, because I will never spam you and you can unsubscribe at any time. Maybe a course in the future, but I'm not sure.

## What is Xerikos? 
Xerikos is my company that I do freelancing through. It's origin is my family's last name. My grandfather was Greek and when he came to the United States he changed his last name from Xerikos to Harrison after a Harrison department store. There were some things that I needed a company for when applying for Azure previews so I created one and that's the domain I'm using for the newsletter! 

## Where can I subscribe? 
You can subscribe to the newsletter by filling out the form on the top of my blog azurebarista.com. I will send you a confirmation email and then you can unsubscribe at any time. 

## What if I have a Specific Question?
I am always happy to help you with any questions. You can reply to the newsletter, message me on LinkedIn, or any other social network!
