## Why Is AI Important

In today's ever-changing world, AI is becoming more and more important. So many companies are slashing budgets and cutting jobs. AI is a great way for companies to increase output and hopefully keep headcount the same! Recently, Google has credited AI with their double digit growth in revenue while keeping headcount the same. I believe as budgets tighten more and more companies will want their workforce to be more efficient and AI is a great way to do that.

## Where Have I Been? Why Should You Listen To Me?

Hi! If you don't know who I am, but somehow made it to my blog, Welcome! I am Alec Harrison a software enthusiast with just over half a decade of software development experience. I am a Microsoft MVP in both Azure and AI! That is new since my last post I believe. I also am a Linkedin Learning Instructor and have a course teaching learners about the Generative AI portion of AI-102 exam (reach out to me if you'd like a free 3 month trial to it). I still run a few user groups! I have also launched a podcast called [Azure Cloud Talk!](https://azure-cloud-talk.simplecast.com) In that podcast I chat with my friend and fellow MVP [Brian Gorman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianlgorman) where we sometimes have guests and discuss all things tech! I have been busy, but I am back and ready to start blogging again!

#### Why Should You Listen To Me?

Being in consulting I feel like I can hear and see things play out across multiple industries and companies. Everyone seems to be talking about a softer market and for the most part I can't just sneeze and find 6 tech jobs anymore. I also have been helping an over 1 billion dollar company implement AI into their business. That has gone from custom applications all the way to helping with adoption of SAAS (software as a service) products. I have seen the benefits of AI first hand and I am excited to share my knowledge with you!

## Why Should You Care?
I think AI is going through a big shakeup right now. A lot of people are using different AI tools for daily productivity gains, while others are feeling like they are going through the trough of disillusionment. I think it is important to keep up with the latest trends. 

#### Efficiency
AI can help you be much more efficient in your day to day tasks. Using so many tools like GitHub Copilot, Office 365 Copilot, Security Copilot are making everyone's jobs better each and every day. We even have tools like [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) launching AI features that can help you write, monitor, save money, and secure your infrastructure. All of these help you be more efficient and get more done in your day. Can you imagine just pointing Pulumi at your deployed cloud infrastructure and getting a report on how to save possibly thousands a month in spend or empowering developers to write infrastructure as code! That is the power of AI!

#### Trough Of Disillusionment
One final thought I think I'd give on AI is we are going through the trough of disillusionment. If you haven't heard of that term before, it's basically the point where people are thinking AI is over-hyped. However, a Bill Gates quote once said that we may over estimate the change of a technology on the world in 2 years, but we underestimate the change in 10 years. I think that is very true with AI. We are in the trough of disillusionment, but I think in 10 years we will look back and see how much AI has changed the world. I think it is important to keep up with the latest trends and keep learning about AI.
