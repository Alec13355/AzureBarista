If you haven't heard of Microsoft Build "Microsoft Build (often stylised as //build/) is an annual conference event held by Microsoft, aimed at software engineers and web developers using Windows, Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft technologies." According to wikipedia. My plan/goal of this post is to link ideas or new things I want to dig into and then use this blog post as a homepage to new blog posts I will write as I dig into things. Some of these posts will be hosted and linked to my company's blog (https://www.sourceallies.com/blog/index.html) so don't be freaked out if stying drastically changes when clicking a link. 

1. Microsoft Build overall thoughts and was it worth it? 
2. You can host AKS on your own stuff!
3. Cosmos DB has a free teir (and serverless offering)?
4. Github code spaces? 
5. Azure Arc?
6. Azure Ledger? 
7. Project Reunion?
8. Low Code/No Code?
