# Azure Barista Newsletter 1st Edition!

![Azure Barista Logo](https://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1389757000000070614_zc_v1_1736225420747_azurebarista.jpg)

## Hey there!

Welcome to the first edition of Azure Barista Newsletter!

### Who Am I?

![Profile Photo](https://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1389757000000070614_zc_v1_1736226263861_me.jpeg)

I am Alec Harrison, a Microsoft MVP in AI and Azure, a software development enthusiast passionate about test-driven development, cloud technologies, and agile methodologies. In my free time you'll find me learning about new Azure technologies and helping to running a few user groups!

### What's the reason for this newsletter?

This newsletter is more than just sharing updates—it's about creating a community where knowledge fuels innovation. With the rapid evolution of technology, staying informed can be overwhelming. This newsletter will bridge the gap, delivering the most important news, tips, and trends in a concise, approachable way. By curating insights and actionable content, I will empower readers to harness Azure's potential, make informed decisions, and stay ahead in the cloud landscape. This isn't just a newsletter; it's a fresh brew of inspiration for professionals ready to elevate their skills and transform their organizations.

I am also hoping this will also be a one stop shop for anyone who wants to keep up with what I am working on!

### Join me on Meetup! Most events are virtual friendly!

Next event is being announced soon it will be on 1/14/25!
