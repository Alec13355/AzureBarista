This is the steps I followed to get my blog to Azure. Since Microsoft is moving towards Github and Github actions. I figured this would be a good first introduction for myself for myself to Github actions and a place I could document it for others too! 

This blog is based off of [Gatsby's own website here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-azure/). My plan is to add commentary or clarity where I got stuck.

## Get Code to Github
The first thing is to create a Gatsby project and then get it to a Github repo. You can find guidance on that in multiple places. Such as the Gatsby link or Github, too.
