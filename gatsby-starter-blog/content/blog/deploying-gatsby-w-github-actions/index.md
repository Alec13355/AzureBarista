description: Deploying Gatsby with Github actions to Azure

This is the steps I followed to get my blog to Azure. Since Microsoft is moving towards Github and Github actions. I figured this would be a good first introduction for myself for myself to Github actions and a place I could document it for others too! 

This blog is based off of [Gatsby's own website here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-azure/). My plan is to add commentary or clarity where I got stuck.

So fast forward and attempting to do this I have to say I'm very impressed by Gatsby's blog. The most difficult part was mapping my site to my google domain (and that was just throwing a cname on my DNS). This was super easy thanks to Gatsby's guide.
