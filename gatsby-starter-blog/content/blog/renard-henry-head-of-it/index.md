# Engineering the Future: Key Takeaways from Our Chat with Renard Henry, Head of IT at Toyota Connected

We recently had the distinct pleasure of hosting Renard Henry, Head of IT at Toyota Connected North America, on "Engineering in the Loop." The conversation was a fascinating dive into the realities of AI in the automotive industry, Toyota's innovative spirit, and the leadership principles that drive success in a fast-paced tech environment. Renard brought a wealth of experience, not just from his current role but from a diverse career spanning finance, healthcare, and even a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu!

Here are some of my key takeaways from our enlightening discussion:

### 1. AI Isn't New, Especially at Toyota – It's Evolving
One of the first myth-busters Renard dropped was the idea that AI is a brand-new phenomenon in vehicles. As he put it, "AI in some aspects is around in the vehicle before anyone even started talking about it. If you're talking about lane assist, it's AI that's doing it." This really resonated. While generative AI is grabbing current headlines, Toyota has been leveraging AI for features like lane assist and safety systems for years. It’s a testament to their forward-thinking approach – they were having conversations about AI "a couple of years ago" that many are just starting now.

### 2. Innovation with Purpose: Safety and Reliability First
Toyota's reputation for reliability isn't just about long-lasting engines; it extends to how they approach new technology. Renard highlighted how Toyota Connected is focused on the "infotainment system and the safety connect of the vehicle." He gave compelling examples: "How can we use AI in order to tell if someone's in an accident to make that phone call in order to save their life? How can we put AI far as from a medical standpoint, Hey, someone's having a heart attack." This pragmatic, human-centric application of AI – focusing on tangible benefits like saving lives through Safety Connect – underscores a responsible innovation strategy. It's not just about the flashiest tech, but the most impactful.

### 3. The Fast Lane of Development: Agility in Action
I was particularly struck by Renard's description of the work pace at Toyota Connected: "We go from having a conversation to testing all in the same day." This agility is a powerful counter-narrative to the often-bureaucratic image of large corporations. It’s clear that Toyota’s lean manufacturing principles are alive and well within their tech hub, allowing them to "build, iterate" and avoid getting bogged down in "change control" when speed and responsiveness are paramount.

### 4. Leadership Lessons from Unexpected Places
Renard's journey into tech leadership wasn't a straight line – starting with sports medicine, moving through various industries, and finding inspiration for leadership from his 14 years training in Jiu-Jitsu. He mentioned taking "a lot of aspects from jujitsu in order to lead other teams, pay it forward, look for other opportunities, never look at them as failures." This philosophy of continuous learning, resilience, and seeing challenges as opportunities is invaluable in any field, but especially in the ever-evolving world of technology.

### 5. The Future of AI: Embrace, Understand, and Govern
Looking ahead, Renard offered a balanced perspective on AI's future. While acknowledging the potential for fully autonomous vehicles ("eventually we're going to get to that part"), he also stressed that current autonomous tech is "too early" for him to be an avid fan. His advice regarding AI's impact on jobs was particularly pertinent: "AI is not going to take your job... But if you don't grasp and understand what AI is going to do now and in the future, someone who knows is going to take your job from you."

Crucially, he emphasized the growing need for **AI governance**. As companies rush to adopt AI, "Shadow IT" can become a real issue, with different departments potentially using multiple, unvetted AI tools. Renard stressed the importance of standardizing, creating guardrails, and ensuring that InfoSec teams play a key role in deciding "what we're going to be able to bring in, how much are we going to let it have access to." This strategic approach is vital to harness AI's benefits while mitigating risks like data leaks.

### 6. Solving Real Problems: The "Why" Behind Tech Adoption
Towards the end, Renard made a powerful point about evaluating new technologies. Instead of chasing the "new shiny," the focus should always be on the "why." "What is your why? Why do we need this? What is it going to solve?... How is this going to make the business better? How is it going to make it faster? How is it going to affect growth?" This problem-solving mindset, ensuring that any new tech adoption, especially AI, serves a clear business purpose and delivers a return on investment, is a critical discipline.

Our conversation with Renard Henry was packed with insights, and these are just a few highlights. It’s clear that Toyota Connected is not just keeping pace with technological advancements but is actively shaping them with a thoughtful, human-centric approach.
