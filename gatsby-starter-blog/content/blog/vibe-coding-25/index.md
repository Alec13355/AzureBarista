# If You're "Vibe Coding" You're Doing It Wrong!

I think people who make doom and gloom posts about AI and vibe coding causing a huge demand in developers are just wrong. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but in general I think coding with AI is making people who use it correctly much more efficient and there's studies to support this.

## Why Should You Trust Me?

- I am a **Microsoft MVP in AI & Azure**.
- I am a **LinkedIn Learning Instructor**.
- I am an **Expert on Microsoft for Startups network**.

I help companies adopt generative AI custom solutions, and I spend quite a bit of my day telling people AI isn't the answer to their solutions.

## On "Vibe Coding" and Coding Practices

Saying that *"vibe coding"* is causing a ton of security vulnerabilities, poor code, or other issues is, in my opinion, just a case of people writing code wrong with AI. It's the same as saying a garbage collector, compiler, IDE, Google, or StackOverflow are making developers write bad code.

> In my opinion, people having all of these issues are those who are putting way too much faith into an LLM and just accepting the answer.  
> It is the same as people who write a massive feature and then ship the code without running it. While you can sometimes get away with writing whole features at a time, typically you will end up trying to debug your massive wall of code and it won't work, because you didn't test it along the way.

## How Should You Be Writing Code ‚Äî AI or Otherwise?

Let's say we are trying to write a CSV parser and then combine columns and save it off elsewhere or return it in an object.

You could:
- Sit down, write all of the logic, and hope and pray it works.

**Alternatively, you could:**
- ‚≠ê **Read the CSV**
- ‚≠ê **Parse Each Line**
- ‚≠ê **Print Specific Columns**
- ‚≠ê **Build a DTO**
- ‚≠ê **Return the Object**

In the latter pattern, whether it's AI-assisted or manual, you're not overcomplicating code and introducing issues by blindly building and hoping for the best.

I think if we chunk code into smaller parts‚Äîwhether using TDD, AI-generated code, or just writing small, clean methods‚Äîyour code will turn out better. **Period.**
