## Getting Started
We first are going to need an Azure AI Foundry resource and AI Project. Once we do that we are going to create an agent. All agents we create end up in the agent view like this!
![Agent View](./Agent.png)
In this view we can now configure some additional tools for our agents to use! 
![Configuration](./Config.png)
The first option is adding knowledge. We can a few different sources like a file, Azure AI index, and some models allow for Bing Search for grounding data! 
![Data Sources](./DataSources.png)
The file section supports quite a few file types!

We can also use code interpreter to programmatically do things!

It supports a wide range of files!

## Start Testing Out Agents
Once we have our agent fully configured we can start testing out our agent!

Now we can start testing out our agent!

We can continue to see how our agent is doing by looking at the chat history! Once we are satisfied with our agent we can save it and start using it in our applications!
