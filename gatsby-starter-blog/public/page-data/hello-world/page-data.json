For this first post I’m going to make it an introduction post, my goal for this site, and anything else that comes to mind!</p>\n<h2>Who Am I?</h2>\n<p>My name is Alec Harrison and I am a Software Engineer at Growers Edge. On my current client/team I was exposed to Azure, .Net, DevOps and have been loving it ever since. </p>\n<h2>Why Barista?</h2>\n<p>You maybe wondering why the name Azure Barista? Well, I’ve been on my as an apprentice and right away after I graduated from college. I used to make the joke at standup that I “forgot the coffee again”. Playing on the joke of that the intern always brings everyone coffee. Fast forward to a cold October morning we all decided to pickup coffee on the way back to Source Allies’ office from our client. Being a little chilly and on the way to the office I volunteered to pickup everyone’s order on the way to the office. After that Maggie Pena (my co-worker and awesome Azure Barista logo designer) pointed out the irony of me bringing everyone coffee. After that the name and logo stuck. </p>\n<h2>Goal of the site?</h2>\n<p>The goal of this website and blog is to showcase anything I maybe digging around and document it or talk about any fun things I stumble across. This can include anything from building an Azure DevOps pipeline all the way to configuring MSAL on an application. This can also include any additional learning I do after an IMAUG (Iowa Microsoft Azure User Group) meeting. I hope you enjoy these posts as much as I enjoy writing them.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intro Blog Post","date":"March 28, 2021","description":"Who Am I?"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cypress In Azure Using MSAL"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eb398dac-1f00-5920-8ac3-8c656df635ff","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"81e3b33e-ad7b-5f04-a3ba-89a2c0468f8f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
