Since Microsoft is moving towards Github and Github actions. I figured this would be a good first introduction for myself for myself to Github actions and a place I could document it for others too! </p>\n<p>This blog is based off of <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-azure/\">Gatsby’s own website here</a>. My plan is to add commentary or clarity where I got stuck.</p>\n<p>So fast forward and attempting to do this I have to say I’m very impressed by Gatsby’s blog. The most difficult part was mapping my site to my google domain (and that was just throwing a cname on my DNS). This was super easy thanks to Gatsby’s guide.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying Gatsby With Github Actions","date":"April 29, 2021","description":"Deploying Gatsby with Github actions to Azure"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cypress In Azure Using MSAL"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/imaug/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IMAUG"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3434e3e5-d12c-55b3-8a61-33176a7755b7","previousPostId":"81e3b33e-ad7b-5f04-a3ba-89a2c0468f8f","nextPostId":"d830764a-bb7d-51e0-a804-1419014d410f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
